# Rook
CLI based temporary email generator.

# Building
To build it yourself, clone the repository to a local directory. Rook uses [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) to distribute executables, 
so you can just run `pkg index.js` to package the executable for Windows, MacOS and Linux. For more information on pkg, 
please visit their [documentation](https://github.com/vercel/pkg/wiki/Developers).
